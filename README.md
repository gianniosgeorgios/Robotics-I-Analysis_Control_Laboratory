Kinematic analysis of robot manipulator, forward and inverse geometric modeling for "Robotics I" course NTUA 2019-2020


## Abstract

The main purpose of this exercise was the kinematic alanysis of a Robotic Manipulator  so as to perform a straigh movement between two points

## Robotic Manipulator

The robotic manipulator we studied shows up in the below image:
